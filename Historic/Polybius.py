"""
POLYBIUS CIPHER
a.k.a. Polybius square, it is a single substitution cipher.
The first step is to create a 5x5 square matrix containing the alphabet, where "i" and "j" are combined. As a variation, the letter "q" could be removed.
The letters might not be in order, to increase the encryption security.
Each letter is represented by two coordinates in the Polybius square.
